## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict future stock prices of Apple Inc. using statistical features.
- **Method:** Created a linear regression model trained on engineered features (moving averages).
- **Result:** The model showed strong alignment with actual trends, and the residuals fluctuated randomly around zero — indicating a stable, unbiased fit.
